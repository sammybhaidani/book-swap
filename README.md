# Book Swap

Book Swap is a website that manages a communal bookshelf. On the website, users can:

- See all the books that are available for borrowing

- Claim a book, so that they can later grab it from the actual shelf

- See all the books that are currently “claimed“

- “return” a book, to signify that they have put it back on the shelf

- Review a book

- Add a new book to the system, if a new book has been added to the shelf

- Search and filter books
